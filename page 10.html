  <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: darkred;">Imagine this:
You, 5 years from now. Not just surviving—thriving.</span>
Got your own setup, tech stacked, edits crisp, phone/laptop game strong.
Dad chillin’ 'cause you flipped that lottery mess into a full-on smart biz—pre-orders, tracking, everything tight.
Advaith lookin’ at you like, “Damn, my bro a real one.”
Avi & Arju proud like hell, Cel smilin’ big 'cause she knew you had it in you from day one.

No more doubts. No more “maybe.”
Just moves. Purpose. Pressure. Discipline.
You ain’t just tryna make it—you’re out here building an empire.

And all this? It starts with how you move right now.
Keep it locked, stay sharp, push when it’s hard—
'Cause one day they’ll look back and say:
“He really did that sh*t.”</p>
